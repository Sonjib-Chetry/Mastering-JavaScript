    <h1>Welcome to my **90 Days of JavaScript Revision Challenge**!</h1>
    <h2 style="color: red">
      Please read the script file and understand the project and try to build
      your own.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      In this mini project, you'll build a book organizer using higher order
      functions in JavaScript.
    </h3>
    <h1>User Stories</h1>
    <p>
      You should have an array of objects named <strong>books</strong> where
      each object in the array should have a string <strong>title</strong>,
      another string <strong>authorName</strong>, and a number
      <strong>releaseYear</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Your books array should have a minimum of three objects.</p>

    <p>
      You should have a callback function named <strong>sortByYear</strong> that
      accepts two books as parameter for sorting the array.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sortByYear function should return -1 if the releaseYear of the first
      book is smaller than that of the second book.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sortByYear function should return 1 if the releaseYear of the first
      book is bigger than that of the second book.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sortByYear function should return 0 if both releaseYear values are
      equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should filter out books written after a certain year such as 1950 from
      the books array and save the filtered array in a new array named
      <strong>filteredBooks</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should sort the books in the filteredBooks array according to their
      releaseYear in ascending order. You learned in a prior lecture video that
      the sort() method will sort the array in place. This means the
      filteredBooks array will be mutated.
    </p>
    <h1>Tests</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You should have a function <strong>sortByYear</strong> in your code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your <strong>sortByYear</strong> function should take two parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your <strong>sortByYear</strong> function should return -1 if the
        <code>releaseYear</code> of <code>book1</code> object is smaller than
        that of the <code>book2</code> object, 1 if the
        <code>releaseYear</code> of <code>book1</code> object is larger than
        that of the <code>book2</code> object, and 0 in all other scenarios.
      </li>
      <li>You should have an array <strong>books</strong> in your code.</li>
      <li>
        Your <strong>books</strong> array should have at least three book
        objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your <strong>books</strong> array should contain objects each with a
        string <code>title</code>, another string <code>authorName</code>, and a
        number <code>releaseYear</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should have an array <strong>filteredBooks</strong> in your code.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>filteredBooks</strong> array should have some of the books
        filtered out from the <strong>books</strong> array and not be empty.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should call the <code>sort</code> higher order function by passing
        the <strong>sortByYear</strong> callback function on the
        <strong>filteredBooks</strong> array.
      </li>
    </ol>
