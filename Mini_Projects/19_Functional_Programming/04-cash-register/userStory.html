 <h1>Cash Register App</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Here you'll build a cash register app that will return change to the customer 
      based on the price of the item, the amount of cash provided by the customer, 
      and the amount of cash in the cash drawer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll also need to show different messages to the user in different scenarios, 
      such as when the customer provides too little cash or when the cash drawer 
      doesn't have enough to issue the correct change.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Provided Variables</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>price</code>: the price of the item</li>
      <li><code>cid</code>: the cash-in-drawer, which is a 2D array listing the available currency in the drawer</li>
      <li><code>cash</code>: (to be added) the amount of cash provided by the customer, provided via an input element</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you'd like to test your application with different values for <code>price</code> and <code>cid</code>, 
      make sure to declare them with the <code>let</code> keyword so they can be reassigned by our tests.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Application Behavior</h2>
    <p>Your application should show different messages depending on conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Status: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS</b>: if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.</li>
      <li><b>Status: CLOSED</b>: if cash-in-drawer is equal to the change due.</li>
      <li><b>Status: OPEN</b>: if cash-in-drawer is greater than the change due and you can return change, with the change due in coins and bills sorted in highest to lowest order.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Currency Units</h2>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Currency Unit</th><th>Amount</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Penny</td><td>$0.01 (PENNY)</td></tr>
