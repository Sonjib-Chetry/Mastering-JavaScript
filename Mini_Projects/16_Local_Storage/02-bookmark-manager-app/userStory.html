    <h3>
      For this mini project, you'll build a bookmark manager app. You'll utilize local
      storage to store bookmarks, and practice how to add, remove, and display
      bookmarks.
    </h3>

    <h2>User Stories:</h2>
    <p>
      You should have a getBookmarks function that returns the bookmarks array
      stored in the local storage. If the bookmarks key has not been set yet, or
      it doesn't contain a valid array with bookmarks, the getBookmarks function
      should return an empty array.<br /><br />

      The bookmarks key stored in the local storage should be an array of
      bookmark objects. Each bookmark object should have three keys: name,
      category, and url.<br /><br />

      You should have a function named displayOrCloseForm that toggles the
      hidden class on #main-section and #form-section.<br /><br />

      When you click #add-bookmark-button, you should update the inner text of
      .category-name to be the value of the selected option from
      #category-dropdown and call displayOrCloseForm to display the form section
      and hide the main section.<br /><br />

      When you click #close-form-button, you should run your function to hide
      the form section and display the main section.<br /><br />

      When you click #add-bookmark-button-form, you should update the bookmarks
      key stored in the local storage by adding a bookmark object to the end of
      the array. The object should have name set to the value of the #name
      input, category set to the value of the selected option from the category
      dropdown, and url set to the value of the #url input.<br /><br />

      Once the bookmarks key is updated, you should reset the value of #name and
      #url to an empty string before running your function to hide the form
      section and show the main section.<br /><br />

      You should have a function named displayOrHideCategory that toggles the
      hidden class on #main-section and #bookmark-list-section.<br /><br />

      When you click #view-category-button, you should update the inner text of
      .category-name to be the value of the selected option from
      #category-dropdown, modify the inner HTML of #category-list according to
      the user stories below, and call the displayOrHideCategory function.<br /><br />

      If none of the bookmarks in local storage have the category, you should
      set the inner HTML of the #category-list to a p element with the text No
      Bookmarks Found.<br /><br />

      If one or more bookmarks in local storage have the selected category, add
      a radio button for each bookmark to the innerHTML of the #category-list.
      Give each radio button an id and value set to the bookmark name, and a
      name that's the same for all the buttons.<br /><br />

      Each radio button should have a corresponding label containing an anchor
      element with the bookmark name and the href attribute set to the bookmark
      URL.<br /><br />

      When you click the #close-list-button, you should run your function to
      hide the #bookmark-list-section and display the main section.<br /><br />

      When you click the #delete-bookmark-button, you should delete the bookmark
      corresponding to the selected radio button and appropriate category from
      the local storage and update the displayed bookmark list.

    <h2>Tests:</h2>
    <p>
      1. You should have a getBookmarks function.<br />
      2. Your getBookmarks function should return an array.<br />
      3. Your getBookmarks function should return the bookmarks key from
      localStorage.<br />
      4. When the bookmarks key is not set in localStorage or is an empty array,
      the getBookmarks function should return an empty array.<br />
      5. When the bookmarks key in the localStorage does not contain a valid
      array of bookmark objects, the getBookmarks function should return an
      empty array.<br />
      6. You should have a function named displayOrCloseForm.<br />
      7. Your displayOrCloseForm function should toggle the hidden class on
      #main-section and #form-section.<br />
      8. When you click #add-bookmark-button, you should update the inner text
      of .category-name to be the value of the selected option from
      #category-dropdown.<br />
      9. When you click #add-bookmark-button, you should call displayOrCloseForm
      to display the form section and hide the main section.<br />
      10. When you click #close-form-button, you should call displayOrCloseForm
      to hide the form section and display the main section.<br />
      11. When you click #add-bookmark-button-form, you should update the
      bookmarks key stored in the local storage by adding an object to the end
      of the array. The added object should have name set to the value of the
      #name input, category set to the value of the selected option from the
      category dropdown, and url set to the value of the #url input.<br />
      12. When you click #add-bookmark-button-form, you should reset the value
      of #name and #url to an empty string.<br />
      13. When you click #add-bookmark-button-form, you should run
      displayOrCloseForm to hide the form section and show the main section.<br />
      14. You should have a function named displayOrHideCategory.<br />
      15. Your displayOrHideCategory function should toggle the hidden class on
      #main-section and #bookmark-list-section.<br />
      16. When you click #view-category-button, you should update the inner text
      of .category-name to be the value of the selected option from
      #category-dropdown.<br />
      17. When you click #view-category-button, you should add a p element with
      the text No Bookmarks Found to #category-list's inner HTML if none of the
      bookmarks in local storage have the selected category.<br />
      18. When you click the #view-category-button, you should modify the
      #category-list element's inner HTML by adding a radio button. The radio
      button should have the id and value attributes set to the bookmark name
      for each bookmark in the selected category. Additionally, each radio
      button should have the same name attribute.<br />
      19. Each radio button added to #category-list's inner HTML should have a
      corresponding label containing an anchor element with the bookmark name
      and the href attribute set to the bookmark URL.<br />
      20. Each label element should contain an anchor element with the bookmark
      name as text, and the href attribute set to the bookmark URL.<br />
      21. When you click #close-list-button, you should hide
      #bookmark-list-section and display the main section.<br />
      22. When you click the #close-list-button and then open any category, the
      #category-list should contain only data relevant for the selected
      category, without duplicating entries.<br />
      23. When you click the #delete-bookmark-button, you should delete the
      bookmark corresponding to the selected radio button and appropriate
      category from the local storage and update the displayed bookmark list.
