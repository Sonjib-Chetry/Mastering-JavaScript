      Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store
      key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps
      to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

      In this mini project, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local
      storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks,
      implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.
    </h3>

    <h2>User Story</h2>
<pre>
As a user, I want to manage a list of tasks so that I can add, edit, delete, and view tasks easily.

Requirements:
1. The application should store tasks in localStorage so they persist after refresh.
2. The user can open a form to add a new task by clicking "Open Task Form".
3. The form should have:
   - Title (required)
   - Date
   - Description
4. When the user submits the form:
   - If Title is empty, show an alert "Please provide a title".
   - A new task object is created with:
        id: a unique string based on title and timestamp
        title: title without special characters
        date: entered date
        description: description without special characters
   - If editing an existing task, update it instead of adding a new one.
5. Tasks are displayed with:
   - Title
   - Date
   - Description
   - Edit and Delete buttons
6. Clicking "Edit" loads the task into the form for editing.
7. Clicking "Delete" removes the task from UI and localStorage.
8. If the form is closed with unsaved changes, show a confirmation dialog with Cancel/Discard.
9. The UI should update dynamically whenever tasks are added, edited, or deleted.
10. Input values should be sanitized by trimming whitespace and removing special characters except letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens.
</pre>

<h2>Test Cases</h2>
<pre>
1. Adding a Task:
   - Given the title "My Task", date "2025-08-10", description "Sample work"
   - When the form is submitted
   - Then the task should appear in the task list and in localStorage.

2. Title Validation:
   - Given an empty title field
   - When the form is submitted
   - Then an alert "Please provide a title" should be shown and the task should not be added.

3. Editing a Task:
   - Given a task exists
   - When "Edit" is clicked, form fields should be populated with the task data.
   - After editing title and clicking "Update Task"
   - Then the updated task should replace the old one in the list and localStorage.

4. Deleting a Task:
   - Given a task exists
   - When "Delete" is clicked
   - Then the task should be removed from the UI and localStorage.

5. Close Form Without Saving:
   - Given the form is open with unsaved changes
   - When "Close" is clicked
   - Then a confirmation dialog should appear with "Cancel" and "Discard".
   - If "Cancel" is clicked, the form remains open.
   - If "Discard" is clicked, form closes and changes are lost.

6. Data Persistence:
   - Given multiple tasks are added
   - When the page is refreshed
   - Then tasks should still appear from localStorage.

7. Input Sanitization:
   - Given a title with special characters "Hello@World!"
   - When saved
   - Then it should be stored and displayed as "HelloWorld".

8. Unique ID:
   - Given two tasks with the same title
   - When added at different times
   - Then their IDs should still be unique because of timestamp.
