    <h1>Welcome to my **90 Days of JavaScript Revision Challenge**!</h1>

      Please read the script file and understand the project and try to Debug at
      your own.

    <h3>
      In this mini project, you'll debug a random background color changer and
      fix the errors to make it work properly.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Camperbot is learning JavaScript and has tried to build their own Random
      Background Color Changer. However, they have made a few mistakes along the
      way. Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass so the
      project is functioning properly.
    </h3>

    <h2>User Stories:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You should fix the syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array.</li>
      <li>
        You should fix the ReferenceError thrown when the math object is
        referenced inside the getRandomIndex function.
      </li>
      <li>You should round down randomIndex to the nearest whole number.</li>
      <li>
        You should update the value of the body variable to use the correct
        method name and fix the related TypeError.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should fix bgHexCodeSpanElement so that it correctly selects the
        element with the id of bg-hex-code.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should modify the color variable inside changeBackgroundColor so
        that it is set to a random color from the darkColorsArr array.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should update the btn variable so that it targets the button
        element. Open up the index.html to see the correct id name for that
        button element.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should fix the line that adds an event listener for the click event
        to btn by passing a reference to the changeBackgroundColor function to
        the method.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your background should randomly change to one of the colors in
        darkColorsArr each time the #btn is clicked.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tests:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You should resolve the syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array.
        Remember that array elements should be separated by commas.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should fix the capitalization error in the math.random() line.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should round darkColorsArr.length * Math.random() down to the
        nearest whole number.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should update the value of your body variable so that queryselector
        uses camel case.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should fix "bg-hex-code" so it correctly references the id of
        bg-hex-code. Remember that id selectors in CSS start with a hash symbol
        (#).
      </li>
      <li>
        You should call the getRandomIndex function inside the
        darkColorsArr[getRandomIndex] line.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should fix the id name of "#click-btn" line to match the correct id
        name in the index.html file.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should not call the changeBackgroundColor function. Instead, you
        should pass the function reference to the addEventListener method.
      </li>
    </ol>
