    <h3>
      For this mini project, you'll use JavaScript to validate a customer
      complaint form. You'll practice how to validate form inputs, display error
      messages, and prevent the form from submitting if there are errors.
    </h3>

    <h2>User Stories:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When the form is submitted, you should ensure that:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>#full-name is not empty.</li>
        <li>#email is a valid email address format.</li>
        <li>#order-no is a sequence of ten numbers starting with 2024.</li>
        <li>
          #product-code follows the pattern XX##-X###-XX#, where X represents
          either a lowercase letter or an uppercase letter and # represents a
          number.
        </li>
        <li>#quantity is a positive integer.</li>
        <li>at least one checkbox from #complaints-group is checked.</li>
        <li>
          #complaint-description contains at least twenty characters if the
          Other checkbox is checked.
        </li>
        <li>a radio button from #solutions-group is selected.</li>
        <li>
          #solution-description contains at least twenty characters if the Other
          radio button is selected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        You should have a function named validateForm that returns an object
        containing the following keys: full-name, email, order-no, product-code,
        quantity, complaints-group, complaint-description, solutions-group, and
        solution-description. The value of each key should be true if the
        corresponding form field is correctly filled and false otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should have a function named isValid that takes the object returned
        by validateForm as argument and returns true if every form field is
        correctly filled and false otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a change event is triggered on a form field and it has a valid value,
        you should set its border color to green. In case of checkbox and radio
        button groups, you should set the border color of the parent fieldset.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a change event is triggered on a form field and it has an invalid
        value, you should set its border color to red. In case of checkbox and
        radio button groups, you should set the border color of the parent
        fieldset.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you try to submit the form you should call isValid to validate the
        form.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you try to submit the form, if the form has any invalid field, each
        invalid field should be highlighted by setting the border color of each
        invalid input, textarea or fieldset (in case of checkbox and radio
        button groups) to red.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tests</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You should have a function named validateForm.</li>
      <li>validateForm should return an object.</li>
      <li>

        and true otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a change event is triggered on #full-name, you should set its
        border color to green if it contains a valid value, and red otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        validateForm()["email"] should be true when #email contains a valid
        email address, and false otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a change event is triggered on #email, you should set its border
        color to green if it contains a valid email address, and red otherwise.

        When none of the checkboxes from #complaints-group is checked,
        validateForm()["complaints-group"] should be false.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once one checkbox from #complaints-group is checked, you should set
        #complaints-group's border color to green.
      </li>
      <li>
        When all of the checkboxes from #complaints-group are changed to the
        unchecked state, you should set #complaints-group's border color to red.
      </li>
      <li>
        When #other-complaint is checked and #complaint-description contains at
        least twenty characters, validateForm()["complaint-description"] should

      </li>
      <li>
        When #other-complaint is checked and #complaint-description contains

        validateForm()["solutions-group"] should be false.

      <li>
        Once a radio button from #solutions-group is checked, you should set
        #solutions-group's border color to green.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the form is submitted and all of the radio buttons from
        #solutions-group are in the unchecked state, you should set
