      Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to
      accept input from a user. In this calorie counter mini project, you'll
      practice how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that
      input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.
      You'll also practice basic regular expressions, template literals, the
      addEventListener() method, and more.

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>As a user, I want to input a daily calorie budget.</li>
        <li>
          As a user, I want to add multiple food or exercise entries categorized
          by meal types (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Exercise).
        </li>
        <li>
          As a user, I want to see dynamically added input fields for food or
          exercise entries based on my selection.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a user, I want to calculate total calories consumed and burned, and
          see whether I’m in surplus or deficit.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a user, I want the app to prevent invalid input like scientific
          notation or negative numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a user, I want to clear all fields and reset the form with a single
          click.
        </li>

      <h2>Test Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ✅ The page should contain an input with id="budget" for entering the
          calorie budget.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ There should be a select element with id="entry-dropdown" to choose
          the meal type.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Clicking the button with id="add-entry" should append new labeled
          text and number input fields inside the corresponding
          `.input-container`.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ The form submission should calculate and display:
          <ul>
            <li>Budgeted calories</li>
            <li>Consumed calories (sum of Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)</li>
            <li>Burned calories (from Exercise)</li>
            <li>Remaining calories and whether it’s a Deficit or Surplus</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ When an invalid calorie input (e.g., 1e6) is entered, an alert with
          “Invalid Input” should appear and calculation should abort.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Clicking the "Clear" button with id="clear" should:
          <ul>
            <li>Clear all input fields</li>
            <li>Hide the result section</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ When valid values are entered and submitted, the results should
          appear in the #output element and include calorie stats and
          deficit/surplus.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ The `getCaloriesFromInputs()` function should sanitize values and
          convert them to numbers before summing.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Each entry should have unique ids based on entry type and index
          (e.g., breakfast-1-name, lunch-2-calories).
        </li>
