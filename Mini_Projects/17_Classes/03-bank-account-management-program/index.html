    <h3>
      In this mini project, you'll build a simple transaction management system
      for a bank account.
    </h3>

    <h2>User Stories:</h2>

    <p>
      You should define a class named BankAccount with a constructor. The
      constructor should set the default balance to 0 and initialize an empty
      array named transactions to store transaction records as objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each transaction stored in the transactions array should be an object with
      two properties: type and amount. The type property should be either
      deposit or withdraw, and the amount property should be the amount
      deposited or withdrawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should define a method named deposit that takes the deposit amount as
      a parameter. When the deposit amount is greater than 0, it should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of deposit and
        the amount deposited.
      </li>
      <li>Update the balance.</li>
      <li>
        Return "Successfully deposited $[amount]. New balance: $[balance]".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the amount is less than or equal to 0, the deposit method should return
      "Deposit amount must be greater than zero.".
    </p>

    <p>
      You should define a method named withdraw that takes an amount as a
      parameter. This method should update the current balance according to
      withdrawals. When the amount to be withdrawn is greater than 0 and less
      than or equal to the current balance, it should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of withdraw and
        the amount withdrawn.
      </li>
      <li>Update the balance.</li>
      <li>
        Return "Successfully withdrew $[amount]. New balance: $[balance]".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to 0 or greater than
      the current balance, the withdraw method should return "Insufficient
      balance or invalid amount.".
    </p>

    <p>
      You should define a method named checkBalance that returns the current
      balance in the format "Current balance: $[balance]".
    </p>

    <p>
      You should define a method named listAllDeposits that iterates through the
      transactions array and returns all deposits in the format "Deposits:
      amount,amount,...".
    </p>

    <p>
      You should define a method named listAllWithdrawals that iterates through
      the transactions array and returns all withdrawals in the format
      "Withdrawals: amount,amount,...".
    </p>

    <p>You should create a new instance of BankAccount named myAccount.</p>

    <p>Your myAccount bank account should have at least five transactions.</p>

    <p>Your myAccount bank account should have at least two deposits.</p>

    <p>Your myAccount bank account should have at least two withdrawals.</p>

    <p>Your myAccount bank account should have a balance greater than $100.</p>
