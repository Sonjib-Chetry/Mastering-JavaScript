    <h3>
      In this mini project, you'll build a project idea board using OOP in
      JavaScript. You'll practice how to create classes, add methods to classes,
      and create instances of classes.
    </h3>

    <h2>User Stories:</h2>
    <p>
      You should define an object constant named projectStatus with the three
      keys: PENDING, SUCCESS, and FAILURE. Each status should be assigned an
      object with a description key with the value Pending Execution, Executed
      Successfully, and Execution Failed, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should define a class named ProjectIdea with a constructor that takes
      title and description as parameters. Initialize the title and description
      properties with the provided parameters. The class should also have a
      property named status that is set to the value projectStatus.PENDING by
      default.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should define a method named updateProjectStatus inside the
      ProjectIdea class. This method should accept a newStatus parameter and
      update the status property to the given value.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should define a ProjectIdeaBoard class with a constructor that accepts
      a title and initializes an empty array named ideas to hold instances of
      the ProjectIdea class.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should define a method named pin inside the ProjectIdeaBoard class
      that accepts an instance of the ProjectIdea class and pushes the given
      instance to the ideas array.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should define a method named unpin inside the ProjectIdeaBoard class.
      This method should accept an instance of the ProjectIdea class and removes
      it from the ideas array.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should define a method named count that returns the number of project
      ideas in the given ProjectIdeaBoard array.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should define a method named formatToString that returns the name of
      the projects ideas, their description and status in the format:
    </p>
    <pre>
Example Code
&lt;ProjectIdeaBoard title&gt; has &lt;ProjectIdeaBoard count&gt; idea(s)
&lt;ProjectIdea title&gt; (&lt;ProjectIdea status description&gt;) - &lt;ProjectIdea description&gt;
&lt;ProjectIdea title&gt; (&lt;ProjectIdea status description&gt;) - &lt;ProjectIdea description&gt;
