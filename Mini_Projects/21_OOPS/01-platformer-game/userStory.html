    <h3>
      Coding a game is a great way to grasp fundamental programming principles,
      while also creating an interactive gaming experience. In this platformer
      game project, you'll continue to learn about classes, objects,
      inheritance, and encapsulation. You'll also learn how to design and
      organize game elements efficiently and gain insights into problem-solving
      and code reusability.

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a <code>Start Screen</code> with a button
          <code>#start-btn</code>. When clicked, it should hide the start screen
          and display a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element where the game runs.
        </li>

        <li>
          Initialize the <code>canvas</code> to the full width and height of the
          browser window. Get the <code>2D context</code> using
          <code>canvas.getContext("2d")</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Define a <code>Player</code> class that:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Has properties: <code>position</code>, <code>velocity</code>,
              <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Has a <code>draw()</code> method to render the player as a
              rectangle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Has an <code>update()</code> method to apply gravity, update
              position, and prevent leaving canvas boundaries.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Define a <code>Platform</code> class that:
          <ul>
            <li>Draws a green rectangle on the canvas at given coordinates.</li>
            <li>Acts as a surface where the player can land.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Define a <code>CheckPoint</code> class that:
          <ul>
            <li>Draws a gold rectangle at given coordinates.</li>
            <li>Can be “claimed” (hidden) when the player collides with it.</li>
            <li>Displays a checkpoint message on screen when collected.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Create arrays of platform positions and checkpoint positions. Loop
          through them to create <code>Platform</code> and
          <code>CheckPoint</code> objects.
        </li>

        <li>
          Write an <code>animate()</code> function that:
          <ul>
            <li>Clears the canvas every frame.</li>
            <li>Draws all platforms and checkpoints.</li>
            <li>Updates the player position and movement.</li>
            <li>Handles collisions with platforms and checkpoints.</li>
            <li>
              Scrolls the world (platforms and checkpoints shift) as the player
              moves left/right.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Add keyboard event listeners for <code>keydown</code> and
          <code>keyup</code>:
          <ul>
            <li><code>ArrowLeft</code>: move player left.</li>
            <li><code>ArrowRight</code>: move player right.</li>
            <li>
              <code>ArrowUp</code> or <code>Space</code>: make player jump
              upward.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Show a message <code>"You reached a checkpoint!"</code> when hitting a
          checkpoint, and <code>"You reached the final checkpoint!"</code> when
          reaching the last checkpoint. Disable movement after the last
          checkpoint.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Test Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Start Game:</b> Clicking <code>#start-btn</code> hides the start
          screen and shows the canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Player Rendering:</b> On load, a blue square appears at the
          starting position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Player Movement:</b> Pressing <code>ArrowRight</code> moves the
          player right, <code>ArrowLeft</code> moves left.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Jumping:</b> Pressing <code>ArrowUp</code> or
          <code>Space</code> moves the player upward briefly (jump).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gravity:</b> The player falls down if not on a platform, but stops
          when landing on the ground or a platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Boundaries:</b> The player cannot move outside the left or right
          edges of the canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Platform Collision:</b> The player lands on platforms and does not
          fall through them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Checkpoint Collision:</b> When touching a checkpoint, it disappears
          and a message is displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Checkpoint Order:</b> Later checkpoints only activate if previous
          ones were claimed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Final Checkpoint:</b> When the last checkpoint is collected,
          message “You reached the final checkpoint!” is shown and movement is
          disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>World Scrolling:</b> As the player moves right, platforms and
          checkpoints shift left, creating scrolling effect. Moving left shifts
          them back.
        </li>
      </ul>
