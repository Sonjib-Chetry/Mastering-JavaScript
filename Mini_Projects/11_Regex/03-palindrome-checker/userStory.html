    <h1>Welcome to my **90 Days of JavaScript Revision Challenge**!</h1>
    <h2 style="color: red">
      Please read the script file and understand the project and try to build at
      your own.

    <h3>
      For this mini project, you'll build an application that checks whether a
      given word is a palindrome.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards
      and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. Note: You'll need
      to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and
      symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in
      order to check for palindromes. Fulfill the user stories below and get all
      the tests to pass to complete the project.
    </h3>
