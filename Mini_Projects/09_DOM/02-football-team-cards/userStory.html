    <h1>Welcome to my **90 Days of JavaScript Revision Challenge**!</h1>
    <h2 style="color: red">
      Please read the script file and understand the project and try to build
      your own.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      In this mini project, you will build a set of football team cards. The
      user should be able to use the dropdown menu and filter between the
      different players based on their positions.
    </h3>
    <h2>User Stories</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You should create a JavaScript object named
        <code>footballTeam</code> with the following properties:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li><code>team</code>: a string representing the name of the team.</li>
        <li><code>year</code>: a number representing the year.</li>
        <li>
          <code>headCoach</code>: a string containing the head coach's name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>players</code>: an array with at least four player objects.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Each object in the <code>players</code> array should include:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><code>name</code>: a string with the player’s name.</li>
        <li>
          <code>position</code>: a string with one of the following values:
          "forward", "midfielder", "defender", or "goalkeeper".
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>isCaptain</code>: a boolean indicating whether the player is the
          captain. Only one player should have <code>true</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        You should display the values of <code>headCoach</code>,
        <code>team</code>, and <code>year</code> in the HTML elements with ids:
        <code>head-coach</code>, <code>team</code>, and
        <code>year</code> respectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should display each player as a <code>div</code> with class
        <code>player-card</code> inside the <code>#player-cards</code> element.
        Each player card should contain:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> with the player’s name. If the player is
          captain, prepend it with "(Captain)".
        </li>
        <li>
          A <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> with the player’s position, e.g.,
          <code>Position: midfielder</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        You should have a dropdown filter to show players by their position
        (forward, midfielder, defender, goalkeeper, or all).
      </li>
      <li>
        When the dropdown selection changes, only the players matching the
        selected position should be displayed. If "All Players" is selected,
        display all players.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Test Cases</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You should declare a variable <code>footballTeam</code> in your script.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>footballTeam</code> should be an object with four properties:
        <code>team</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>headCoach</code>, and
        <code>players</code>.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>team</code> property should be a string.</li>
      <li>The <code>year</code> property should be a number.</li>
      <li>The <code>headCoach</code> property should be a string.</li>
      <li>
        The <code>players</code> property should be an array of at least four
        objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each player object should have the properties
        <code>name</code> (string), <code>position</code> (valid string), and
        <code>isCaptain</code> (boolean).
      </li>
      <li>
        Only one player should have <code>isCaptain</code> set to
        <code>true</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The values of <code>team</code>, <code>year</code>, and
        <code>headCoach</code> should appear in the correct HTML elements by
        their IDs.
      </li>
      <li>
        All players should be displayed when "All Players" is selected from the
        dropdown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only players with the selected position should be displayed when
        filtering by "Forward".
      </li>
      <li>
        Only players with the selected position should be displayed when
        filtering by "Midfielder".
      </li>
      <li>
        Only players with the selected position should be displayed when
        filtering by "Defender".
      </li>
      <li>
        Only players with the selected position should be displayed when
        filtering by "Goalkeeper".
      </li>
    </ol>
